> This repository contains the 2 course project files for Getting and Cleaning Data course. Specifically, it contains:
    - The R file (run_analysis.R) that includes all R code to satisfy Objectives 1 through 5 as part of the Course Project
    - The 'tidy data set' (TidyData.txt) that was created using the "run_analysis.R" file
    
> Below is a description of the R file, with instructions on how to use it effectively inclded in the R file itself:

> At a high level, 'run_analysis.R' does the following:

> > 1.Merges the training and the test sets from various files as part of the 'Human Activity Recognition Using
    Smartphones' data set, and creates one data set that includes both the training and test data.
    
>>  2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

>>  3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set by matching the appropriate activity labels
    with the activity names. 
    
>>  4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names by matching up the unnamed column names
    with the appropriate variable names from the 'Features' data set.
    
>>  5.Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the mean of each variable for each activity and each subject, and
    writes the 'tidy data set' out as a text file in the folder specified.
    
    
    
Detailed instructions on how to run the analysis are included in the R file. Please ensure to set your working directory
to the appropriate folder that contains all your needed files.
